*   Saving searches.
*   **Future Considerations:**
    *   Integration with a recommendation engine.
    *   Semantic understanding of skills (e.g., knowing "Java" and "J2EE" are related).
    *   Ability to ask follow-up questions to refine results.

**10. Proof of Concept (POC) Plan**

To validate the core functionality and technical feasibility efficiently, the POC will be developed in two phases:

*   **Phase 1: Establish Fast Search Engine with Basic Keyword Capabilities**
    *   **Goal:** Demonstrate real-time search results based on keyword matching against core job data fields.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **Prepare Sample Dataset:** Collect a representative sample of job data (approx. 200-1000 listings) including fields like `title`, `description`, `location`, `company`, and `skills_tags` (if available). Export as JSON.
        2.  **Set Up Lean Search Engine:**
            *   **Recommendation:** Utilize the free tier of a Search-as-a-Service platform (e.g., Typesense Cloud, Algolia) or a lightweight self-hosted option (e.g., Meilisearch).
            *   **Action:** Index the sample job data into the chosen search engine.
        3.  **Build Minimal Search UI:** Develop a simple web page with a search input. Use the search engine's client library to send queries directly to the engine as the user types, displaying results in real-time.
    *   **Outcome:** A working interface where users can type keywords and see relevant job listings update instantly.

*   **Phase 2: Integrate Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance the keyword search with basic natural language understanding to extract key search parameters.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **Choose Cost-Effective LLM API:**
            *   **Recommendation:** Utilize Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API or OpenAI API (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4o`) via their free tiers or initial credits.
        2.  **Develop Backend Shim/Function:** Create a lightweight backend service (e.g., serverless function) that:
            *   Accepts the raw natural language query from the UI.
            *   Prompts the chosen LLM API to extract entities (role, skills, location, attributes like 'remote') and return them as structured JSON.
            *   Translates this structured JSON into a precise query for the search engine established in Phase 1.
            *   Returns search results to the UI.
        3.  **Update UI:** Modify the UI to send queries to this backend shim instead of directly to the search engine.
    *   **Outcome:** A POC demonstrating users typing natural language queries, the system interpreting these queries to extract search parameters, and displaying relevant, real-time job results.

This phased approach allows for rapid iteration, quick demonstration of core value, and controlled complexity and cost during the POC development.
