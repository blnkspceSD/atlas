Why? Because we’re sitting on a 50,000+ person email list that’s been drastically underutilized.

Helping one freelancer at a time, through real relationships, impactful strategy, and the right message at the right time.</p><p>If the idea of owning and optimizing our entire email channel — writing with a sharp, human voice, communicating with some of the most talented freelancers in the world (Grammy-winning music producers, high-end designers, etc.), and building campaigns that drive measurable results — gets you excited, keep reading.</p><p>‎ </p><div class=\"h3\"><strong>What You'll Do</strong></div><p>As our Email Marketing Strategist, your role is to create, write, and manage a weekly flow of emails that nurture, educate, and book strategy calls — all while making sure our list looks forward to hearing from us.</p><p>You’ll manage our email content calendar, plan campaigns around launches and events, write value-packed emails that still drive action, and send weekly reports on what’s working, what’s not, and what you’re testing next.</p><p><strong>You’ll own our entire email strategy</strong>. That means everything from regular value emails to booked call pushes, live event sequences, re-engagement flows, and segmentation-based testing. If it touches email, it’s in your domain.</p><p>You’ll also work closely with our founder (Brian Hood) to create and deploy better campaigns and resources that support our entire list and sales pipeline.</p><div class=\"h3\"><strong>Your 3 Main Responsibilities:</strong></div><ol style=\"\"> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Strategy &amp; Execution:</strong> You own and execute a strategic, data-driven email marketing calendar that warms leads, books calls, and sustains trust long term.</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Campaigns &amp; Testing:</strong> You proactively test, learn, and iterate on the content and format of our emails to steadily improve conversion and performance.</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>List Health &amp; Reporting:</strong> You monitor and maintain the overall health and performance of our list and report findings clearly each week (qualified booked calls per 10k sends, CTR, Unsubscribes, deliverability, etc).</li> </ol><p>The emails you write will do more than fill up our sales team’s calendars — they'll spark <em><strong>real</strong></em> change for the freelancers on our email list. Your words will help someone finally land that dream client, raise their rates with confidence, or quit the soul-sucking day job that’s been holding them back.</p><p>Every campaign you write is a chance to move someone forward, not just through strategy, but through belief. <em>That’s</em> the real work here — and why it matters.</p><p>‎ </p><div class=\"h3\"><strong>You’ll be accountable for these KPIs:</strong></div><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Qualified* Booked Calls per 10,000 Emails Sent</strong> = 1–2 </li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Monthly Booked Calls from Email</strong>** = 50–75 baseline, 100+ stretch goal</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Open Rate</strong> = 35–45%</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Clickthrough Rate (CTR)</strong> = 2–4%</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Booking Conversion from Clicks</strong> = 5%+</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Unsubscribe Rate</strong> = &lt;4% per month (total list churn)</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Spam Complaints</strong> = &lt; 0.01% per email (we currently average 1 to 3 total complaints per email sent)</li> <li style=\"\"> <strong>Weekly Email Reporting:</strong> Submitted each Monday.</li> </ul><p>*<em>Qualified = The sales rep has reviewed the call application and accepted it.

It's the ability to critically reflect on oneself and one's relations from an external perspective. With this in mind, we act with objectivity and always remember that we are not our work. There's no perfect science to growing a team or business, but we trust everyone at Replicant to point out our blind spots and humbly admit their own.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Replicant is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

We build local partnerships with shelters, food pantries, and other community-based organizations to turn them into a site of care. As a support system for the community, we provide wraparound clinical services, up-skill CBO staff to become Community Health Workers, and utilize our proprietary data-driven technology platform, Arc, for care coordination. Through Medicaid MCOs, we provide healthcare for hard-to-reach, high-need individuals, while sharing healthcare dollars with community groups to expand their social support programs.<strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Our Values:</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Lead with integrity:</strong> We keep our commitments and take responsibility for our actions.

In partnership with McMaster University, we developed Casper in 2004 to measure the durable, human skills that matter in health professions and beyond. That vision came to life with the founding of Altus Assessments in 2014.</p><p>Meanwhile, One45 started in 1998 at the University of British Columbia helping medical education programs digitize complex processes like curriculum management, scheduling, and assessment. Over time, it became a trusted partner to programs across North America and beyond.</p><p>In 2021, Altus Assessments acquired One45, and in 2022, we unified as Acuity Insights, a single, growing organization with a shared purpose and broader vision.</p><p>What started as two distinct products is now one integrated mission supported by our Analytics platform, which delivers actionable insights to drive continuous improvement across the learner journey.</p><p>Today, our solutions support students and institutions from admissions to graduation across North America, the U.K., Australia, and Saudi Arabia. </p><p>As we continue to grow, we’re committed to being more than a software provider. We’re trusted thought leaders and valued advisors in higher education, offering practical solutions, strategic insights, and guidance that help our partners make confident, informed decisions.</p><div class=\"h3\">Life at Acuity Insights</div><p>At Acuity Insights, you’ll be part of a team of 130+ professionals. While we primarily collaborate virtually, we foster strong social connections and opportunities for in-person co-working.</p><p>Our core values - caring, curious, and driven - guide how we work.

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're a small but growing team — we expanded from 89 to over 151 members last year, and we anticipate further growth in 2025.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h2\"><strong>The Job</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Growing the number of clients we serve at Atticus is one of the hardest and most rewarding things we do. Because the legal marketing space is highly competitive and heavily regulated, we seek innovative ways to reach our clients during the biggest crises of their lives while also setting Atticus apart from sketchy billboard lawyers and sell-your-info schemes. The Growth Lead role mixes traditional marketing and acquisition (testing new platforms, managing campaigns, gathering and analyzing data) with responsibilities unique to a quickly scaling a tech company (developing partnerships, working with product leaders to tailor our UX to different audiences, creative briefing, and building our data infrastructure). In a typical week, you might do any or all of the following:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Launch and improve upon new marketing campaigns on paid social channels</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"> Partner with Creative to drive our paid social creative process, from concept development &amp; briefing to test roadmap creation</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Leverage contractors or creative agencies as needed to augment our internal capabilities</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with Product and Engineering teams to tailor client product experience to the needs of our unique audience</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help create the strategy for growing our client acquisition machine as we scale Atticus from Series B to owning the market</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup in a position that mixes growth marketing execution and innovation, encourages mentorship from leaders across a variety of disciplines, and prioritizes autonomy to shape our acquisition strategy as we scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h2\"><strong>Qualifications:</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Required:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You joined a top digital advertising agency or growth-marketing organization out of college and have been promoted because of your stellar performance.</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong quantitative analytical skills and are comfortable working in data analytics platforms and data visualization software.</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re an ambitious self-starter.

By gifting students a $1,000 investment portfolio along with the knowledge to make it grow, we empower them to take control of their financial futures. We create meaningful opportunities for high school students to explore the value of investing, equipping them with real-world skills and experiences that last a lifetime.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The Gifted Savings high school program is facilitated through a custom-built web app, which allows students to track their gifted investment portfolios while delivering bite-sized, interactive lessons on investing education. As students progress through the program, they document their journey by sharing short video testimonials, offering insights into their personal growth and the impact of their new financial knowledge. The goal is to help students see the long-term power of saving and holding investments while fueling a growing conversation about financial well-being.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Gifted Savings has created a simple, scalable way for donors to gift investment assets directly to a large cohort of individual recipients (like all the students in a high school).

On Scout, you get a more relevant and growthful interviewing experience, you receive feedback on your performance, and you also get end-to-end support to improve your chances of getting hired.</p>\n<p>If you perform well on the Scout interview, you become eligible for opportunities with all companies in the Scout network (only complete the interview once).</p>\n<p><strong>This role is with our partner company that is actively hiring:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sparkwise</strong></p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>About the company</strong></div>\n<p>Hi, I'm Ari, co-founder and CTO at <a href=\"https://sparkwise.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sparkwise</a>. I've spent 20+ years building learning environments for different learning contexts, and am now focused on supporting transformational learning in the workplace. At Sparkwise, we started with a virtual learning experience that centers collaboration and human connection, and engineered platform and program management tools that can scale to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. We're happy to share that we're looking to bring on a new core member to our engineering team. In this full-stack engineering role, you'll help design, build, and shape the future of product engineering at Sparkwise.</p>\n<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>\n<p>The world is getting faster, faster. To succeed, organizations are pouring in trillions of dollars to adopt new technologies, upskill their people, and transform their teams.</p>\n<p>But it's hard to build new skills, mindsets, and behaviors at scale. Digital content doesn't engage, high-touch live learning can't scale, and AI-only tools lack human connection.</p>\n<p>At Sparkwise, our mission is to scale the best way humans learn and transform by automating McKinsey-caliber collaborative capability building, enabled by AI. Our tech facilitates real-time problem solving, collaboration, and practice in small groups — without the need for live facilitators. Companies use our platform to teach skills, instill excellence, harness collective intelligence, drive change, and more.</p>\n<p>Our clients include world-class organizations such as Harvard Business Publishing, Google, top consulting firms, and more.
