## Dev Changelog - Natural Language Search POC - Day 1

**Date:** 2025-05-18 (Using today's simulated date)

**Objective:** Initiate Proof of Concept (POC) for Natural Language Job Search feature. Focus on Phase 1: Establishing a fast search engine with basic keyword capabilities.

**Key Activities & Decisions:**

1.  **Product Requirements Document (PRD) Finalized:**
    *   Collaboratively drafted and refined the PRD for the Natural Language Search feature (`NLS-PRD.md`).
    *   Key discussions included potential API usage (NLP and Search Engine requirements).
    *   The PRD was updated to include a detailed 2-phase POC plan.

2.  **POC Phase 1 Initiated - Search Engine & Data Setup:**
    *   **Data Source Strategy:**
        *   Initially defined a sample JSON structure and created a small `jobs_data.json`.
        *   Shifted to using the user's existing job data from their MongoDB Atlas database (`AtlasV2`) for a more realistic POC dataset.
    *   **Data Export from MongoDB Atlas:**
        *   Attempted `mongoexport` command-line utility; encountered and resolved issues related to missing Homebrew and MongoDB Database Tools installation, and `mongoexport` option compatibility.
        *   Successfully guided the user through exporting a sample of job data directly from the MongoDB Atlas UI using the Aggregation Pipeline (`$limit` stage followed by `$out` to a temporary collection, then exporting that temporary collection).
        *   User confirmed data exported to `/Users/ferg/Documents/1-Work/Dev/Projects/AtlasV2/atlas-jobs.temp_jobs_export.json`.
    *   **Search Engine Selection:**
        *   Initially considered Typesense for the search engine backend.
        *   **Decision:** Switched to **Algolia** for the POC, leveraging its free tier. The `NLS-PRD.md` was updated to reflect this choice.

**Current Status:**

*   A sample dataset (`atlas-jobs.temp_jobs_export.json`) containing job listings has been successfully exported from MongoDB Atlas.
*   The PRD is up-to-date with the current plan, including the choice of Algolia.

**Next Steps (for next session):**

1.  Inspect and (if necessary) transform the exported `atlas-jobs.temp_jobs_export.json` to match Algolia's required format (especially ensuring an `objectID` field and consistent data types).
2.  Set up an Algolia account, create an application, and an index (e.g., `jobs`).
3.  Obtain Algolia API Keys (Application ID, Search-Only API Key, Admin API Key).
4.  Upload the prepared job data to the Algolia `jobs` index.
5.  Configure searchable attributes and faceting attributes in Algolia for the `jobs` index.
6.  Begin development of the minimal UI for keyword search against the Algolia index.
